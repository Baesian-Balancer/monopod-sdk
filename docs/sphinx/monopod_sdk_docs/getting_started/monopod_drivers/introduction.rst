Introduction
============

This package contains the drivers for the planarized monopod sim2real platform
designed by `OpenSim2Real`. These drivers provide an interface to send commands and
receive observations. The drivers will automatically detect if your system has the
real-time kernel enabled and will enable it inside the communication thread.
